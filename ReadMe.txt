Umbraco8 Loripsum ContentApp
-----------------------------------------------
This is a content app to assist developer with creating dummy test content. It's very time consuming opening Loripsum websites and it also takes up valuable tab space. I have managed to build an app within Umbraco which quickly allows you to spin up test content. I'm hoping this will save you devs a load of time. 
The app is designed for developers so it's only activated for administrator users. This is however configurable in the package.manifest file. See documentation for further details.
